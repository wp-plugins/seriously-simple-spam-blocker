A form validation plugin that uses a simple drag-and-drop image instead of traditional unfriendly CAPTCHA fields.

== Description ==

"Seriously Simple Spam Blocker" is a simple and easy-to-use solution to prevent annoying form spam. It is guaranteed to be 100% effective against automated form submissions and is far more friendly than traditional CAPTCHA fields - all it requires from users is that they drag and drop an image.

It is automatically added to every 'submit' button on your site (with options to hide it from certain pages), so there is no need for any manual setup.

== Usage ==

Simply upload the plugin and you're good to go. By going to Settings > Spam Blocker you can customise the explanatory text users see, the image that is used in the drag-and-drop interface and which page templates the spam blocker is used on.
