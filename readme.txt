This plugin is retired and is not recommended for active use.

== Description ==

"Seriously Simple Spam Blocker" is a simple and easy-to-use solution to prevent annoying form spam. It is guaranteed to be 100% effective against automated form submissions and is far more friendly than traditional CAPTCHA fields - all it requires from users is that they drag and drop an image.

It is automatically added to every 'submit' button on your site (with options to hide it from certain pages), so there is no need for any manual setup.

== Usage ==

Simply upload the plugin and you're good to go. By going to Settings > Spam Blocker you can customise the explanatory text users see, the image that is used in the drag-and-drop interface and which page templates the spam blocker is used on.

== Installation ==

Installing "Seriously Simple Spam Blocker" can be done either by searching for "Seriously Simple Spam Blocker" via the "Plugins > Add New" screen in your WordPress dashboard, or by using the following steps:

1. Download the plugin via WordPress.org.
1. Upload the ZIP file through the "Plugins > Add New > Upload" screen in your WordPress dashboard.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Customise the plugin from its settings page

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The spam blocker shows up where I don't want it to appear. =

On the settings page for the plugin you can select which of the page templates you would like to hide the spam blocker from.

= There is more than one submit button on a page and the spam blocker is behaving strangely. =

If you have more than one submit button on the page then the spam blocker will only work for the first one and will not show correctly on the others.
